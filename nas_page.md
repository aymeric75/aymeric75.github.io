ML Classifiers are used in medical research for diverse tasks. Here the goal was to improve on an existing classifier of EEG signals (that identified in which sleep stage the EEG of a newborn corresponded to).


### 2. Problem

SOA EEG classifier for this task show an accuracy of around 70%, the model used was finely designed with different versions.

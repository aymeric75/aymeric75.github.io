**Project description:** This is the result of my master thesis work.

### 1. Context

ML Classifiers are used in medical research for diverse tasks. Here the goal was to improve on an existing classifier of EEG signals (that identified in which sleep stage the EEG of a newborn corresponded to).


### 2. Problem

A [state-of-the-art EEG classifier](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab5469/meta) already existed for this task, even though the model used was finely designed with different versions, it shows an accuracy of around 70%, some progress was to be made...

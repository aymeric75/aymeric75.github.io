## Multi-Agent System project: the packet world

**Project description:**  [This](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~danny.weyns/events/MASE/group_22.pdf) was the project for the course on Multi-Agent System during my master degree

### 1. Context

A MAS is a software system that instantiates ”agents” evolving in an environment and which interact and work together in order to accomplish a goal that they could not reach without group cooperation. These decentralized software systems allow for more flexibility to deal with complex and dynamic environments.

The goal of this course project was to explore various paradigms of MAS in a testbed called the Packet-World, which consist of a 2D grid where each position (square) can be either filled with an object, or an agent (or be empty). The agents have to collect colored packets and bring them to the matching colored destination.

### 2. Problem

For a MAS to work, several problems have to be taken care of:

- Autonomous behaviour of the agents, i.e. in the simplest scenario, an agent has to be able to pick up a packet and load it at destination
-
